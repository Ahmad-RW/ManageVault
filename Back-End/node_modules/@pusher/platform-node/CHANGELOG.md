## [0.15.1](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.15.0...0.15.1) - 2018-10-31

- Update dependencies

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.14.0...0.15.0) - 2018-10-31

### Changes

- `useQueryString` is now an optional property of `RequestOptions` and defaults to false
- The npm package has been tidied up to only include what is required
- Removed body-parser as a dependency as it's not required

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.13.2...0.14.0) - 2018-09-18

### Changes

- *Breaking*: An instance of `SDKInfo` is now required when instantiating an instance of `BaseClient`. This can either be directly provided to the `BaseClient` and then the base client provided to an instance of `Instance` in the `client` key or the `options` object that `Instance`s initializer takes, or you can provide the `SDKInfo` instance to the `Instance` initializer in the `sdkInfo` key of its `options` parameter
- Removed defaulting to generating a JWT with the `su: true` claim if no JWT is provided to a call to `request`

## [0.13.2](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.13.1...0.13.2) - 2018-08-17

### Additions

- `RequestOption` now exposes a `useQuerystring` attribute that can be used to specify if `query-string` library should be used to parse query string

## [0.13.1](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.13.0...0.13.1) - 2018-07-25

### Changes

- Bump verion of `jsonwebtoken`

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-platform-node/compare/0.12.1...0.13.0) - 2018-04-19

### Additions

- `authenticateWithRefreshToken` has been added if you want to support the `refresh_token` grant type and return refresh tokens as part of the authentication process

### Changes

- `authenticate` no longer returns a `refresh_token` and no longer accepts the `refresh_token` grant type
- Calls to `authenticate` and `authenticateWithRefreshToken` always return an `AuthenticationResponse` that looks like this:

```js
{
  status: number;
  headers: Headers;
  body: TokenResponse | ErrorBody;
}
```

where:

* `status` is the suggested HTTP response status code,
* `headers` are the suggested response `headers`,
* `body` holds either the token payload or an appropriate error payload.

Here is an example of the expected usage, simplified for brevity:

```js
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
  const authPayload = pusher.authenticate(req.body, {});
  res.status(authPayload.status).send(authPayload.body);
});
```
